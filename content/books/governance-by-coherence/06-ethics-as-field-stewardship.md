### Chapter 6 — Ethics as Field Stewardship

After rain, a drop slides from a leaf to the soil, guided by terrain not command. This is natural ethics.

Traditional governance treats ethics as rule‑following. Rules matter, but rigid application distorts reality.

Coherent governance reframes ethics as stewardship of the shared space. The question is not “Does this obey the law?” but “Does this choice strengthen harmony?”

Mechanisms follow: resonance checks before action (does this clarify or distort?), ripple audits after action (what effects remain?). Citizens and leaders alike develop ethical sensitivity, distributing responsibility across society.

Sometimes no option is comfortable. Stewardship guides orientation: choose the path that preserves the system’s capacity to regenerate.

**Key Insight:** Ethics is stewardship of the common field — right action protects and renews the shared space we depend on.
