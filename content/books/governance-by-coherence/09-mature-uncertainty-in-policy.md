### Chapter 9 — Mature Uncertainty in Policy

Lean over a pool. The surface reflects clearly, but depths remain unseen. Knowledge is always like this.

Governments mishandle uncertainty. Some freeze, waiting for certainty. Others cling to dogma. Both fracture. Paralysis leaves crises unresolved. False certainty breaks under stress.

Coherent governance practices mature uncertainty — confidence in what is known, humility about what is not, and discipline to act while acknowledging both. Leaders admit limits. Policies are framed as adaptive hypotheses. Citizens learn to treat uncertainty as fertile ground.

Mechanisms include sunset clauses, adaptive review, dashboards showing confidence levels as well as data. Unknowns are spoken aloud, building tolerance for ambiguity.

**Key Insight:** Acting with humility sustains coherence — name limits, adapt as knowledge grows, and make uncertainty fertile.
