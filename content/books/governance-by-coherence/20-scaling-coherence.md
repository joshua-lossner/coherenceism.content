### Chapter 20 — Scaling Coherence

A candle can light a room but not a city. Scaling requires more than replication. Stretched carelessly, coherence distorts into bureaucracy or hierarchy. The challenge is to grow without losing clarity.

Incoherent systems equate scale with centralization. Local voices are absorbed, decisions flatten into uniformity, complexity is managed through force. The result is brittleness: when the center fails, everything fails.

Coherent governance scales through nested resonance. Cities align with regions. Regions align with nations. Nations align with planetary systems. Each level retains autonomy for what belongs to it while tuning upward and downward.

Digital infrastructure makes this feasible: dashboards showing alignment across levels, distributed deliberation platforms enabling shared decisions without collapsing into sameness. Scaling is harmonization, not centralization — many frequencies tuned to one song.

**Key Insight:** Coherence scales through nesting — local systems adapt while aligning into wider resonance.
