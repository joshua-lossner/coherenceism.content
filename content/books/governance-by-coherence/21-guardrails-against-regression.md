### Chapter 21 — Guardrails Against Regression

Every step forward risks reversal. Revolutions have collapsed into tyranny. Reforms have been eroded. Coherence too can regress without safeguards.

In incoherent systems, regression is frequent because power concentrates in competition. Gains are fragile, overturned by elections, coups, or crashes.

Coherent governance distributes safeguards:

- **Transparency Protocols** making decisions open by default.
    
- **Distributed Checks** through councils, assemblies, and boards.
    
- **Rituals of Presence** helping citizens detect drift into manipulation.
    
- **Education in Field Literacy** training citizens to sense coherence early.
    

These guardrails do not freeze systems. They ensure incoherence, when it arises, is noticed quickly, corrected, and composted into renewal.

**Key Insight:** Guardrails prevent collapse, not mistakes — making misalignment visible and accountability shared turns regression into fuel for growth.
