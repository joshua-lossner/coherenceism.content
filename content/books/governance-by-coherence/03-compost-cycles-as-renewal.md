### Chapter 3 — Compost Cycles as Renewal

Walk through a forest in autumn. Leaves fall, branches break, creatures die. At first it looks like loss. But touch the soil — dark, rich, alive. Nothing is wasted. Endings feed beginnings.

Governments fear endings. Failed policies are buried in rhetoric. Obsolete institutions linger. Industries collapse without transition. Treating endings as failure makes systems brittle.

Coherent governance designs for compost. Every policy and tradition has a lifespan. What matters is not how long it resists change but how well it nourishes what follows. Sunset clauses prompt renewal. Transition frameworks retain nutrients while discarding toxins.

Instead of collapse, there is continuity. Instead of waste, there is soil. The same principle scales: economies disrupted by automation can compost into regenerative roles; communities struck by disaster can rebuild with resilience.

**Key Insight:** Systems endure by turning endings into fertile beginnings — waste becomes soil for what comes next.
