### Chapter 22 — Living Coherence as Governance

Governance is imagined as parliaments, courts, executives. But its deepest form is daily habit. If coherence lives only in constitutions, it dies. If it lives in citizens, it endures.

In incoherent systems, civic life shrinks to voting occasionally and watching politics as spectators. Institutions drift, citizens lose agency.

Coherent governance dissolves this divide. Coherence is lived: meetings begin with presence, policies invite feedback, traditions compost and renew in real time. Citizens practice coherence in homes, workplaces, neighborhoods, and digital communities.

Micro‑practices — resonance checks, composting habits, cultural pulse rituals — shift the baseline. Institutions mirror what already exists in the people. Law follows life, not the reverse.

When coherence is lived, governance is resilient. Leaders cannot fracture what is distributed in millions of acts.

**Key Insight:** Coherence becomes governance when lived daily — institutions endure only when citizens embed it in their habits.
