### Chapter 14 — Technology and Intelligence

In a forest, roots intertwine through fungal networks, exchanging nutrients unseen. What looks like competition is also symbiosis. Technology now plays a similar role — networks linking billions, accelerating both clarity and chaos.

Incoherent governance treats technology as savior or threat. Both views miss the truth: technology amplifies the field it enters. Weak coherence accelerates fracture. Strong coherence spreads clarity.

Coherent governance integrates technology as symbiotic intelligence. AI and networks are not outsiders but instruments within the shared mind. Machines detect patterns; humans provide context, values, creativity. Together they produce more than either could alone.

Mechanisms:

- Stewardship councils evaluating impact on coherence.
    
- Metrics asking whether tools clarify or distort.
    
- Protocols slowing interaction to reduce reactivity.
    
- Platforms designed to diversify perspectives rather than reinforce bubbles.
    

This partnership scales pattern recognition while rooting coherence in human stewardship.

**Key Insight:** Technology is a participant — in coherent governance, it functions as symbiotic intelligence aligned to harmony.
