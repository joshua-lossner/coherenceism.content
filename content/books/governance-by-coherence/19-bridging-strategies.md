### Chapter 19 — Bridging Strategies

Bridges are built piece by piece. Transition from incoherence to coherence follows the same pattern. It cannot be decreed or forced all at once. It must be woven gradually.

Revolutions often replace one rigidity with another. Sustainable transition comes from small‑scale proofs that demonstrate viability and inspire expansion. These are seeds rooted in current soil but already carrying the DNA of coherence.

Examples:

- **Citizen Assemblies by Lot** using resonance‑based deliberation.
    
- **Municipal Coherence Councils** experimenting with compost cycles, presence practices, and coherence metrics.
    
- **Policy Audits for Alignment** reviewing laws for impact on the shared field.
    

Each pilot is small enough to work yet visible enough to matter. When people see conflict resolved with less fracture, or resources circulated with less waste, trust grows. Narratives and rituals frame these not as isolated projects but as steps across a bridge already rising.

**Key Insight:** Transition is built, not declared — pilots prove coherence and weave the bridge from old to new.
