### Chapter 11 — Resource Cycles and Economics

On the forest floor, every leaf and branch becomes food for something else. Nothing is wasted. Human economies break this cycle — surplus destroyed to protect prices, food discarded while others go hungry, waste dumped into soil and sea.

The monetary economy manufactures scarcity. Extraction is called growth, inequality is normalized, collapse follows.

Coherent governance redesigns economics around cycles. The question shifts from “How much money moves?” to “How healthy are the flows of resources?”

Mechanisms:

- Real‑time mapping of common resources.
    
- Distribution guided by sufficiency: everyone’s needs met before surplus is stored.
    
- Surplus feeding commons rather than hoards.
    
- Closed‑loop design where byproducts fuel new processes.
    
- Metrics replacing GDP, measuring circulation, equity, resilience.
    

Circular economies and regenerative agriculture already model this. Coherent governance scales them into foundation. The result is abundance rooted in circulation, not extraction.

**Key Insight:** Healthy economies measure flow, not profit — when resources circulate like ecosystems, scarcity dissolves.
