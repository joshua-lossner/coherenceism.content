### Chapter 4 — Alignment as Decision Integrity

A surfer does not command the wave. They read it, adjust, and position themselves so the swell carries them. The ride comes from attunement, not force.

Incoherent governance makes decisions in advance of reality: rigid ideologies, scripted pledges, talking points. The world shifts but leaders cling to pre‑written answers. Friction follows — policies colliding with conditions, institutions grinding against change.

Coherent governance treats attunement as decision integrity. A decision is valid when it fits the moment and strengthens harmony. This demands feedback, listening, and adjustment. Assemblies ask not “Which side wins?” but “What choice fits the pattern revealed here?”

Dashboards display social, ecological, and cultural indicators so choices remain attuned. Leaders are trained not in dominance but in perception — able to sense when an action clarifies or fractures.

Integrity is measured by fit, not force. Misaligned actions dull the system. Attuned actions resonate outward, even when small.

**Key Insight:** Integrity means positioning decisions so reality carries them forward; fit matters more than force.
