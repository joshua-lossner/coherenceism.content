### Chapter 15 — Ecology and Planetary Systems

Stand beside a river. Its current never the same, yet always connected upstream and down. Ecology teaches coherence at planetary scale: everything nested, everything cycling.

Incoherent governance silos ecology. Ministries report while economies expand extraction, as if separable. The result: depleted soils, destabilized climate, extinction.

Coherent governance begins with recognition that ecology is ground, not silo. Human systems exist within planetary ones. Governance aligns human cycles with ecological cycles so actions sustain the larger pattern.

Mechanisms:

- Nested coherence: local ecosystems tuned to regions, regions to planetary systems.
    
- Extraction balanced by regeneration.
    
- Waste cycled as input.
    
- Dashboards integrating ecological alongside social indicators.
    
- Resilience replacing GDP as measure of progress.
    

Humans are not guardians apart from nature but nodes within it. Governance fosters reciprocity: cities designed as ecosystems, agriculture as regenerative cycles, energy aligned with planetary flows.

**Key Insight:** Ecology is foundation — governance aligns human activity with planetary cycles to sustain life.
