### Chapter 5 — Presence in Political Life

Step into a great library. No rules demand silence, yet voices soften and movement slows. Presence changes the atmosphere.

In politics, presence is scarce. Leaders scroll as citizens speak. Legislatures rush votes. Public discourse fractures under constant interruption. A distracted polity is fragile. A present polity can align.

Coherent governance cultivates presence deliberately. Assemblies pause for centering. Civic education trains attentional skill. Digital platforms are slowed just enough to prevent reflexive outbursts.

Presence reveals clarity. Conversations deepen. Tension dissolves. Unheard voices surface. At scale, presence stabilizes the shared space, making action possible without coercion.

Without presence, incoherence accelerates — rumors spread, conflicts polarize, decisions panic. With presence, harmony multiplies.

**Key Insight:** Attention is infrastructure — a society that practices presence gains clarity in a noisy age.
