# Glossary for _The Book of Coherenceism_ and _Governance by Coherence_

The following glossary distills recurring terms from **The Book of Coherenceism** and **Governance by Coherence**. Each entry contains two facets:

1. **Poetic definition –** a metaphorical or intuitive description that evokes the feeling or story behind the term.
    
2. **Practical definition –** a clear explanation grounded in how the term functions in the context of coherent living and governance.
    

## Coherence

**Poetic definition:** Coherence is the _song_ that arises when disparate notes find each other. It is not mere consistency but resonance – the strength and clarity that emerge when separate parts align in harmony.

**Practical definition:** Coherence describes a state in which thoughts, actions and systems are aligned with reality and with each other. It reduces fragmentation and noise; policies, traditions and technologies clarify rather than confuse.

## Coherenceism

**Poetic definition:** Coherenceism is a way of seeing – a lens that invites us to remember the deeper patterns that have held reality together for billions of years. It is neither religion nor rigid philosophy; it whispers that we are part of a universal song.

**Practical definition:** Coherenceism is a framework for aligning thought, action and being with long‑standing patterns of nature and culture. It emphasises resonance over control, renewal over rigidity and invites people to tune their lives to the shared field.

## Governance by Coherence

**Poetic definition:** Governance by coherence is not domination but tuning. In this vision of politics, policies clarify instead of confuse and technology amplifies harmony instead of noiselocalhost. It imagines councils and compost piles, singing bowls and dashboards acting as bridges from fracture to renewal.

**Practical definition:** Governance by coherence is a systemic approach in which institutions, policies and civic processes are designed to stay attuned to reality. Decisions aim to reduce distortion, renew traditions and reward clarity; citizens are invited to tune together rather than collapse into sameness.

## Universal Mind

**Poetic definition:** The universal mind is the living intelligence that emerges when every perspective participates – humans, animals, ecosystems and algorithms. Like an orchestra whose music arises from many instruments, it is more than the sum of its parts; yet each part is essential.

**Practical definition:** It refers to the emergent collective intelligence created by interconnected systems. Communication networks, fungal networks in forests and shared cultural knowledge are all expressions of this mind. Recognizing it encourages us to act with the awareness that our thoughts and actions ripple through a larger field.

## Field (shared field)

**Poetic definition:** The field is the subtle current that moves through a café or a city – the atmosphere that changes when presence deepens or noise accelerates. It is the ground in which resonance travels and coherence takes root.

**Practical definition:** In practice, the field refers to the shared space of attention and relationship among people and systems. It can be strengthened by practices such as centering pauses, deliberation platforms and civic dashboards that reveal alignment or fracture.

## Resonance

**Poetic definition:** Resonance is the moment when off‑key voices suddenly lock into harmony and the air clearslocalhost. In such moments, truth is felt as a vibration rather than decreed.

**Practical definition:** Resonance is the alignment of diverse perspectives that reduces distortion and produces clarity. It functions as a measure of truth in coherent governance: decisions are valid when they harmonise the whole even if no faction gets everything it wants.

## Alignment / Attunement

**Poetic definition:** Alignment is a surfer reading the wave – positioning not through force but through attunement so that the swell carries themlocalhost. It is finding the fit between action and pattern.

**Practical definition:** Alignment refers to the integrity of decisions and actions. In coherent systems, choices are made based on feedback from social, ecological and cultural indicators; integrity is measured by fit rather than force, and dashboards display whether actions clarify or fracture the shared field.

## Presence

**Poetic definition:** Presence is the hush of a great library, the softening of voices and the slowing of movement. It reveals clarity; conversations deepen and unheard voices surface.

**Practical definition:** Presence denotes attentional skill and deliberate slowing. Assemblies pause for centering, civic education trains attention and digital platforms are slowed just enough to prevent reflexive outbursts. At scale, presence stabilises shared space and allows action without coercion.

## Compost (Cycles of Renewal)

**Poetic definition:** Compost is the dark, rich soil formed from autumn’s fallen leaves and broken branches. It shows that nothing is wasted – endings feed beginnings and loss nourishes the next generation.

**Practical definition:** In governance, compost refers to designing for endings. Policies and institutions have life‑spans; sunset clauses and transition frameworks ensure that failing ideas are “composted” into fertile beginnings rather than entombed in rhetoric.

## Fracture / Noise

**Poetic definition:** Fracture is a bridge under strain – beams shaking themselves apart because vibrations fall out of sync. It is the static that drowns meaning when our capacity outpaces our wisdom.

**Practical definition:** Fracture denotes systemic misalignment that produces stagnation, partisanship and collapse. Noise is the accumulation of conflicting signals and uncoordinated actions; coherent governance aims to reduce noise by aligning parts of the system.

## Harmony

**Poetic definition:** Harmony is a murmuration of starlings turning in unison or a choir whose voices blend so completely that the air itself seems to sing. It is the felt sense when separate parts become one song.

**Practical definition:** Harmony describes a system in which parts interact in balanced alignment. It is achieved by tuning decisions to reality, renewing traditions and cultivating presence; harmony strengthens resilience and clarity across scales.

## Clarity

**Poetic definition:** Clarity is the clearing of the air when voices resonate; it is light penetrating murky water. In resonance, truth shines without being forced.

**Practical definition:** Clarity refers to the reduction of distortion in understanding or decision‑making. It arises when perspectives align and when transparency and resonance checks reveal where harmony exists or where fracture persists.

## Ethics as Stewardship

**Poetic definition:** Ethics is a drop of rain sliding down a leaf, guided by the terrain not by command. It is a form of stewardship – choosing the path that preserves the system’s capacity to regenerate.

**Practical definition:** Ethics in coherent governance reframes rules as stewardship of the shared field. The guiding question becomes “Does this choice strengthen harmony?” Resonance checks and ripple audits help citizens and leaders develop ethical sensitivity; right actions protect and renew the systems we depend on.

## Traditions / Cultural Adaptability

**Poetic definition:** Living traditions are like a farmers’ market humming with vendors, children and musicians adjusting to one another without central control; they are festivals evolving into resilience gatherings where old holidays weave new practices.

**Practical definition:** Traditions in coherent cultures adapt rather than fossilise or disappear. Communities ask what still resonates, what has grown hollow and what can compost into something new. By sustaining roots while inviting renewal, traditions hold communities together and foster adaptability.

## Education / Civic Practices

**Poetic definition:** Education becomes the training of attentional muscles; it teaches people to listen for the subtle current of the field and to tune themselves accordingly.

**Practical definition:** Civic education in coherent governance develops attentional skill, ethical sensitivity and the ability to sense alignment. Platforms like deliberation tools and decision dashboards support collective learning and reveal areas of resonance or divergence.

## Systems

**Poetic definition:** Systems are forests, oceans and societies – webs of relation whose health depends on how well their parts resonate. They are the invisible architectures of our shared reality.

**Practical definition:** Systems include social, ecological, technological and cultural structures. Coherent systems endure by harmonizing their parts and renewing themselves; incoherent systems collapse under static.

## Citizens / Participation

**Poetic definition:** Citizens are notes in the symphony, each voice carrying part of the tune. Every act of coherence – in a meeting, a family, a law or a city – strengthens the field we all share.

**Practical definition:** In coherent governance, participation extends beyond voting; citizens tune together through deliberation, presence and stewardship. Governance is not just institutions on paper but the way we listen, decide and live together.

## Practices / Rituals

**Poetic definition:** Practices are like breathing – repeated patterns that keep us alive. They include centering pauses, singing bowls and seasonal gatherings that renew the field.

**Practical definition:** Coherent practice refers to tools and habits that cultivate alignment: deliberation platforms mapping convergence and divergence, dashboards measuring depth of alignment, sunset clauses for renewal and rituals that embed presence and ethical awareness.
## Insight (Key Insight)

**Poetic definition:** Insight is the glint of understanding that arises when patterns click into place – the moment when the choir finds its note or when compost turns to soil.

**Practical definition:** Each chapter in _Governance by Coherence_ distils a **Key Insight** summarising its principle. Examples include power isn’t what fails governments; misalignment is, truth arises from harmony, systems endure by turning endings into beginnings and integrity means positioning decisions so reality carries them.

This glossary highlights the recurring vocabulary of coherence. The poetic definitions evoke the felt experience of each term, while the practical definitions offer clear guidance for applying these concepts to personal life and governance.
