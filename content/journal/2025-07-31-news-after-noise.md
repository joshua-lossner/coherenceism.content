## **News After Noise**

_Reclaiming Reality in a Coherent World_

_“The truth will set you free — but first it will destabilize your feed.”_

Deepfakes aren’t the root of our crisis of trust. They’re the punctuation mark — the sharp exclamation at the end of a sentence that has been unraveling for decades.

We talk about “losing trust” as though it were once whole. But what’s fading isn’t trust itself — it’s the illusion of it. The priest, the anchor, the headline, the algorithm — they were never truly impartial. They were always framing the story, guiding it toward certain conclusions. We just weren’t meant to see the strings.

### **When Trust Was Outsourced**

For much of modern history, trust came bundled with institutions. You didn’t verify facts; you trusted the source — the nightly news, the textbook, the official statement. And when those sources failed — when they sold wars, shielded the powerful, or silenced dissent — it shook people deeply.

Most didn’t discard the structure. They simply chose new voices to follow. And so the echo chambers grew — Fox or CNN, NPR or Rogan, Reddit or TikTok. Different channels, same dynamic.

### **When the Machines Arrived**

Then came AI. Then came deepfakes. Suddenly, even your own eyes and ears could be deceived with precision. We weren’t just questioning the credibility of institutions — we were questioning reality itself.

For many, that realization felt like the ground giving way. But perhaps it’s not entirely bad. Perhaps this collapse is an invitation — to stop outsourcing our sense of truth and start finding our way back to it, slowly and directly.

### **Functional Truth**

Not all information is equal. There is a difference between manufactured consent and what I call _functional truth_.

You see it in quiet corners of the internet: someone showing you how to repair a dryer, cultivate a garden, or set up a server in their garage. The proof is in the outcome. The trust is earned, not by authority, but by contact with reality.

That is coherence — the kind of truth that survives testing, that aligns with the patterns of the real world.

### **News in a Coherent Society**

In a coherent system, “news” would not be a race to break the most attention-grabbing story. It would slow down. It would strip away the spectacle.

It would be grounded in relevance:

- News is not narrative; it is observation.
- It is signal, not noise.
- It invites collective interpretation rather than dictating conclusions.
- It asks: _Does this matter to our well-being, our resources, our trust, our ecological stability?_

Celebrity scandals and hourly outrage cycles would give way to the lived pulse of our communities.

### **From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems**

Instead of chasing distractions, people would focus on what directly shapes their shared world:

- The condition of the soil in their gardens
- The needs of their neighbors
- The shifts in local weather, energy, or transport
- The changes that require their participation

News would become relational — less about what’s happening “out there” and more about how the world is changing _around us_, and what we can do within it.

### **You’re the Editor Now**

  In a coherent society, no single institution does your filtering for you. You learn to hold that responsibility yourself — to discern what matters, what’s true, what deserves your attention.

And you are not alone in that work. Tools, communities, and a slower societal rhythm help. But ultimately, you come to trust not the brand, not the voice, not even the footage — but the quiet recognition inside that tells you when something fits, when something’s real.

That’s coherence.

And maybe the most important news of all isn’t what’s breaking.

It’s what’s mending.
