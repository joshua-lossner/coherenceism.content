# Carrying Capacity and the Cult of Chaos

_Or: How to Stop Wasting a Planet Like It’s an Office Birthday Cake_

---

**Spoiler: The Earth isn’t running out of stuff—it’s running out of patience.**
### **Carrying Capacity? More Like** 

### **Carrying Catastrophe**

Everyone loves to argue about how many humans can fit on the planetary bus before the wheels fall off. Wrong question. It’s not “How many people can Earth support?” It’s “How many self-sabotaging clowns can Earth babysit before it calls the manager?”

Carrying capacity isn’t fixed. It flexes. It groans. It sighs every time we choose profit over practicality. The planet could handle billions more—if we weren’t playing Hunger Games with the food, tech, and toilet paper.

### **We Have the Food. We Just Don’t Have the Sense.**

Oh look, enough food to feed 10 billion people—sitting right there, growing, chilling, getting tossed because supermarkets want “perfect” produce while 800 million humans are hangry and invisible.

The issue isn’t food production. It’s the system acting like food is a limited-edition NFT. Change the damn game—ditch the meat mountains, eat more plants, stop throwing edible stuff away like it’s last season’s TikTok trend.

### **The Money Matrix: Where We Waste to “Create Value”**

Billions of machines and humans dedicate their entire existence to… tracking money. Not building homes. Not teaching kids. Not healing bodies. Just moving numbers around so hedge funds can high-five each other while the sea levels rise.

Skyscrapers full of hot air. Data centers hotter than the sun. All to defend imaginary digits from other imaginary digits. If money were food, we’d be stuffing golden cheeseburgers into safes while people starve outside.

### **Competition: Late-Stage Capitalism’s Favorite Waste Sport**

If aliens landed, they’d ask why we built 17 different smartphone chargers and none of them fit. They’d leave immediately.

Every pharma company reinvents the same pill because “sharing” is for communists. Every tech giant creates new plugs just to sell you more crap. Efficiency? That’s for nature. Humans prefer profit-laced redundancy.

### **Politics: Sponsored by Chaos™**

Governments could fix stuff—but they’re busy cosplaying as stockbrokers. Policies don’t solve; they preserve. Designed by lobbyists, run by billionaires, and justified with buzzwords like “growth” and “freedom” while dismantling both.

It’s not broken. It’s a very functional Rube Goldberg machine that turns resources into yachts for sociopaths.

### **Enter: Coherence (a.k.a. Let’s Stop Punching Ourselves)**

  

Imagine a world where decisions aren’t made by sociopathic spreadsheets. Where collaboration isn’t a buzzword but a blueprint. Where research is open-source and your phone charger actually fits your phone.

  

Coherence isn’t utopia. It’s common sense, drunk on espresso and allergic to BS. It means designing systems that _work_—not because they’re profitable, but because they make life suck less.

### **Conclusion? Ditch the Stupidity, Not the Species**

Earth isn’t mad. It’s disappointed. We’ve got everything we need to thrive—except the will to stop reenacting “Survivor: Late Capitalist Edition.”

Want a future? Stop worshipping scarcity. Start organizing abundance. Eat the inefficiencies. Reboot the code. And maybe—just maybe—build a world where “carrying capacity” is a flex, not a threat.
