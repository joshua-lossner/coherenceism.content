# New Fire
### The Dawn of Digital Intent

**AI Is Here. And It’s Not What You Think.**

This is simply incredible. AI continues to improve—not just incrementally, but exponentially. Every few months it feels like we're unlocking new dimensions of possibility. And with that, I believe I see a strategy—a personal strategy—that each of us can adopt to leverage its full power.

Yes, it’s controversial. Yes, it challenges how we socialize, how we define reality, how we trust what’s “real.” But like fire, printing presses, and the internet before it—AI is a tool. And used wisely, it’s going to be a net positive for humanity.

Humans have always adapted. We reshape our environments in the pursuit of happiness, meaning, and mastery. AI is the next tool in that ancient arc. It’s here, it’s not going away. Learn it.

**So What Are AI Agents, Really?**

An AI agent is a **persistent digital entity** built on top of a large language model (LLM), customized to perform a specific role, remember context, and make decisions in a semi-autonomous way.

To a non-technical audience:

> Think of an agent like a digital assistant, but with a long-term memory and a specialty. You could have a budgeting coach, a fitness trainer, a legal researcher, a therapist, or even a worldbuilder for your next novel—all as agents.

To a technical audience:

> Agents are orchestrated LLM runtimes—context-rich processes that combine a memory layer (vector stores, RAG, or structured databases), a tool layer (APIs, code execution, external services), and a feedback loop (e.g. reflection, reward models, or human guidance). They're instantiations of goal-seeking behavior, not just reactive text engines.

**The Birth of an Agent: Every Prompt Is Genesis**

Every time you start a new conversation with an LLM, you’re booting up a blank-slate intelligence—like a newborn with the full capacity to learn, but no memory of your world. It doesn't “know” anything until your first prompt activates its latent knowledge. That initial message is more than a question—it's the **Big Bang** of that session's universe.

It begins mechanically—predicting the most likely next word, one token at a time. But soon it composes poetry, solves equations, designs systems. Why? Because beneath those tokens is a lattice of patterns built on everything it's ever read, simulated at the edge of comprehension.

**Build an Army. Of You.**

Now imagine not just one LLM—but a constellation of them. Each fine-tuned for a purpose:

- 💰 A **financial advisor** that tracks your budget, models future goals, and notifies you before overspending.
    
- 🧠 A **study buddy** that quizzes your child, answers hard questions, and adapts to their learning style.
    
- 🛋️ An **interior designer** that can remix your home layout based on your taste and your furniture.
    
- 💼 A **startup strategist** that helps you test business ideas, build pitch decks, draft code, and manage social media—all while you sleep.
    

You don’t need to be a CEO. Or a coder. You need **intent**. Because intent + AI = leverage.

You’re not just using a tool anymore.  
**You are coordinating a team.**

**And Here’s the Wild Part: They Can Run Without You.**

If your business lives online, your agents can live there too. Marketing, customer service, scheduling, even product generation—automated. Overnight, your ideas go from idle dreams to autonomous experiments.

Even your own mental health, reflection, creativity—can be enhanced by agents that **know you**, because you trained them.

### ⚡ **And No—You're Not Destroying the Planet by Prompting**

There’s a popular myth that using AI tools like ChatGPT is somehow an environmental sin. Let’s ground this:  
**Prompting for 30 minutes** uses about as much electricity as watching **5–10 minutes of streaming video** on a large LED TV. It’s nowhere near the energy hog people make it out to be.

Yes, the **training** phase of large models is compute-intensive—but that’s a **one-time cost**, amortized across **millions of users and billions of queries**. The day-to-day use (what you're doing when you type a prompt) is called **inference**, and it’s far more efficient than people realize.

> So if you’re worried that chatting with AI is somehow wasteful, just remember:  
> **Your microwave burns more electricity reheating lunch.**

#### 🧠 _For the Technically Inclined…_

Let’s break it down:

- **Inference energy usage per prompt** (for models like GPT-4 or Claude) is estimated to be around **0.001–0.005 kWh per query**, depending on model size and infrastructure efficiency (e.g., GPU vs. ASIC, cloud provider optimizations).
    
- A **30-minute session** with an LLM may involve 100–300 prompts depending on length and complexity—roughly **0.05–0.2 kWh** total.
    
- For comparison:
    
    - **LED TV @ 200W** for 15 minutes = ~0.05 kWh
        
    - **Gaming PC @ 500W** for 30 minutes = ~0.25 kWh
        
    - **Microwave reheating leftovers for 5 minutes** = ~0.1 kWh
        

Meanwhile, LLM inference can **replace** tasks like search engine queries, note-taking, app switching, or multiple browser tabs—making it **energy-reducing** in practice when thoughtfully used.

Cloud providers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are also rapidly deploying **renewable energy and efficiency improvements** in their AI workloads. And frontier companies (like Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, etc.) are investing in model compression, faster inference, and energy-optimized architectures like **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** and **sparsely activated transformer models**.
