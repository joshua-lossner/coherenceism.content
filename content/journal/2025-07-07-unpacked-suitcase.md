## **🧳 The Audacity of the Unpacked Suitcase**

**“Sometimes the loudest journey is the one that never leaves the living room.”**
(And sometimes the most revolutionary act is making coffee in your pajamas.)

This morning, we stood face-to-face with a suitcase that had big dreams—Italy, maybe Denver, at the very least an overpriced AirBnB with bad Wi-Fi. It still rested in the closet expectant and hollow, like a motivational speaker at a nap convention. But instead of filling it with socks and sunscreen, I ate a breakfast sandwhich and listened to my heart rates decelerate like wise a old monk.

The thrill of not going anywhere? Shockingly underrated.

### **🔇 The Static of “Should”**

As the caffeine settled, that familiar little guilt-gnome chimed in:

_“You should be going somewhere. Seeing things. Doing epic, postable stuff.”_

Yeah, that voice? Not ours. It’s the twisted lovechild of hustle culture, Facebook envy, and the corporate-industrial vacation complex. It wants rest to be scheduled, branded, and turned into a LinkedIn post titled “10 Ways Bali Made Me a Better Scrum Master.”

Today we politely yeet that voice out the metaphorical window.

### **🔧 Rest as a System Requirement**

In Coherenceism, we don’t treat rest as a bug—it’s infrastructure. Necessary maintenance. Like oil changes for your psyche.

- **Biological coherence**: Your cortisol levels need a hammock.
- **Creative coherence**: Your brain blooms in silence, not Microsoft Teams.
- **Moral coherence**: Stillness reveals the compass hiding under the noise.

This isn’t absence. It’s alignment.

### **🧘 Designing Rituals of Slowness**

Instead of airfare, we’re booking vibes:

- **Analog Day**: Phones off, vinyl on, and only handwritten notes. (Pens are just analog dopamine devices.)
- **Micro-Adventure**: A slow sunrise walk with Bernie the philosophical dog—novelty without TSA lines.
- **Lantern Hour**: Lights dimmed post-9 PM, fiction and melatonin on tap.
 
These aren’t to-do items. They’re to-be zones.

### **✊ The Quiet Rebellion of Doing Less**

Choosing rest in a world addicted to performance metrics? That’s some low-key punk rock. Every moment of intentional stillness is a raised middle finger to the culture of endless output.

We’re not underachieving—we’re recharging like poetic cyborgs.

### **📝 Dear Future Us (a.k.a. July 15 You Maniacs)**

When the project storm hits—when Teams notifications multiply like gremlins—remember this entry. Remember the calm, the cold soda, and Bernie’s majestic snore. Remember that stillness was not a detour. It was fuel.

### **🌧️ Closing Image**

Rain etches soft Morse code on our Des Moines window. The suitcase is still empty. So are we—and that’s the point.

Inhale. Exhale.

That’s our boarding pass.
