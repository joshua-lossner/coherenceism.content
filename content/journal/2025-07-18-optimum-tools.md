# Choosing Better Tools
## Why Smart People Still Do Dumb Things

Ever notice how humans are basically raccoons with Wi-Fi—hoarding shiny junk even when better stuff’s available? Jacque Fresco certainly did. The guy basically spent his life yelling into the void, “Hey, maybe stop worshipping broken tools just because your grandpa did.” Spoiler: we didn’t listen.

Case in point: fossil fuels. In 2024, governments handed oil and gas companies a casual **$7 trillion**—enough to buy every human on Earth a coffee… every day… for a decade. Renewable energy? Cleaner. Cheaper. Smarter. But nooo, we’re still treating oil like it’s grandma’s secret sauce. That’s what happens when outdated tools get turbocharged by outdated incentives.

Now compare that to LED light bulbs. The second they got cheaper and the rules changed, we collectively dumped incandescents like they were last year’s meme. No emotional breakdown. No “save the filament” rallies. Just a clean switch to something that made _sense_. Why? Because, as Fresco said, the environment (not your big brain) decides what tools you pick. Price tags, policies, and peer pressure run the show.

Fast forward to today: the new overlord isn’t Big Oil—it’s Big Algorithm. Instead of selling you bulbs, it’s selling your attention back to you at a 300% markup. Social media apps are basically slot machines that spew dopamine instead of quarters. We know scrolling is turning our brains into digital oatmeal, but hey—everyone else is doing it, and the heart reacts faster than the prefrontal cortex. Thanks, evolution.

Fresco also warned about trying to do _everything, everywhere, all at once_. Your phone buzzes, your email howls, your to-do list mocks you like an evil gremlin. Surprise! Your brain, a squishy three-pound relic built for berry-picking and mammoth-avoiding, isn’t built for a hundred notifications a day. That’s why Monday feels like a hangover and Wednesday feels like a lie.

Pain and pleasure? Also relative. Soldiers don’t feel gunshot wounds in the heat of battle, and we barely feel the existential wound of our 90-minute commute because rent is due. We put up with low-grade misery like it’s a subscription service we forgot to cancel. All because we’ve confused what’s necessary with what’s just… familiar.

And let’s not forget our specialty: compartmentalization. You can build an AI model at work and then go home and believe your cousin’s Facebook post about lizard people running the government. It’s not stupidity—it’s environmental logic. Work rewards rationality. Social media rewards tribal bonding. Boom: split-brain behavior. Thanks, civilization!

So what’s the fix? No, it’s not downloading another productivity app. It’s redesigning the _playground_. Want better tools? Reward better behaviors. Kill the fossil fuel subsidies. Give perks to people who choose better. Make rest as respected as hustle. And personally? Start small. Audit your habits like a ruthless accountant with trust issues. Trade soul-sucking rituals for stuff that actually feels good _and_ does good.

Fresco’s real wisdom? It’s not about “smarter” tools. It’s about smarter _rules_. Create an environment that rewards sane, sustainable, satisfying choices. That’s not utopia—it’s just common sense with a facelift.

Change the incentives, and people change their minds. The best tool isn’t the fanciest—it’s the one the system quietly nudges you to use. So let’s nudge wisely, shall we?
