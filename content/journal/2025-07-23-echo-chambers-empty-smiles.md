We don’t give social media nearly enough credit. Sure, the headlines are full of dire warnings about screen time and dopamine hits, but maybe the real problem isn’t the tool—it’s the society holding it. We’ve grown up in a world that prizes selfishness, idolizes narcissism, and turns cruelty into a competitive sport. So when we scroll through highlight reels of happiness, maybe the knot in your stomach isn’t from envy—maybe it’s from the gut-wrenching realization that your joy's been outsourced to someone else's curated feed.

Yes, that existential dread whispering that you’re just another cog, endlessly spinning in a machine you never asked to be a part of? That’s valid. But don’t let that pain blind you to the fact that social media is still one of the most powerful tools we have for resistance and mobilization.

Remember the Arab Spring? The uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East in the late 2000s and early 2010s weren’t orchestrated in back rooms—they were mobilized on Twitter. Protesters in Cairo were being supported by activists in Chicago. It was global. It was digital. And it scared the hell out of those in power. That’s when the backlash began.

Suddenly, those who had once praised the democratic potential of social media were sounding the alarm. "It’s dangerous! It’s divisive! It’s corrupting the youth!" Which, ironically, is exactly what they said about rock music, comic books, and books written by women. But the truth? They realized social media could organize people—and not just bake sales, but revolutions. So, they co-opted it. They built right-wing echo chambers, they weaponized misinformation, and yes, they got help. Russia didn’t spend hundreds of millions with Cambridge Analytica for funsies. That was AI's trial run against democracy.

And now, the same people who told you social media is a cesspool want you to be scared of AI too. “It’s full of fake news!” they cry, while using it to spread their own ideology with terrifying efficiency. Misinformation isn’t new, folks. It predates AI, social media, the Internet, even the printing press. You don’t defeat lies by running from them. You beat them by talking. Loudly. Passionately. Repeatedly.

So where are you? Hiding in the algorithmic shadows while bootlickers hijack our tools? Paralyzed by a fear of saying the wrong thing while fascists say the worst things loudly and often?

It’s time to speak up.

We don’t need more ten-second photo ops of fake smiles. We need voices. We need real conversations. We need you—not your avatar, not your curated self—but the messy, furious, hopeful you. Because families are still being torn apart. Structural violence is still chewing through the working class like it’s brunch. And no filter will fix that.

So, please. Speak. The. Fuck. Up.
