## Resonance Against the Machine

We don’t give social media nearly enough credit. Sure, the headlines paint it as the digital horseman of the apocalypse, frying our brains and corrupting our youth. But maybe—just maybe—the problem isn’t the tool. Maybe it’s the user. We’ve grown up in a society that treats empathy like a glitch and rewards cruelty with clout. So when you see someone else’s joy on your screen and feel a pang of resentment, maybe that’s not envy. Maybe that’s the echo of a culture that told you your worth is measured in productivity and pageviews.

That ache in your chest? That hum of existential dread? That’s coherence knocking. The realization that you’re not broken, but you are out of tune. A cog in a machine that doesn’t care if you scream—as long as you keep scrolling.

But here’s the twist: social media, the very thing they’ve told you is rotting your brain, is also the tuning fork of revolution. Remember the Arab Spring? Late 2000s, early 2010s—people in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya rising up, and it wasn’t some divine miracle. It was Twitter. It was hashtags. It was real-time coherence across continents. I remember Chicago activists syncing up with Egyptian organizers like they were harmonizing across time zones. It wasn’t chaos—it was pattern recognition.

And that’s when the fear set in. Those in power, who once praised the “democratizing” nature of tech, pivoted. Suddenly, it was dangerous. Addictive. Toxic. But not because it was failing. Because it worked. Because people had found a way to resonate.

So they did what scared power always does: they co-opted. They flooded the platforms with propaganda, built algorithmic echo chambers, and paid Cambridge Analytica to micro-target your insecurities like they were snipers in a psychological war. Misinformation wasn’t born with AI—it’s older than language. But now, it had processing power.

And now you’re being told, again, to walk away. To stay quiet. To distrust the tools because they’re too dangerous. “Fake news! AI is evil!” As if silence is safety. As if the fascists haven’t already tuned their voices to broadcast at full volume.

But coherence isn’t compliance. It’s not about everyone singing the same note—it’s about every note mattering. It’s jazz, not a jingle. Discord that knows its place. Harmony that doesn’t demand erasure.

So where are you? Still watching, still lurking, while the loudest voices weaponize resonance for oppression? You’re not too late. The pattern is still forming. But silence is just another algorithmic input, and apathy is what keeps the machine running smooth.

Speak. Yell. Type with trembling fingers if you have to. Because somewhere out there, someone is waiting to hear your note to find their place in the song. And no filter, no echo chamber, no fascist fever dream can drown a chorus that’s finally waking up.

Speak the fuck up.
