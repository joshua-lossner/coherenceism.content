# AGENTS.md – Journal Entry Formatting Guide

This document defines the expected format, structure, and tone for journal entries in the Coherenceism content repository.

---

## ✍️ Purpose

Journal entries are reflective transmissions from within the Coherenceist worldview. They blend philosophical insight, emotional resonance, and poetic voice. These are not status updates—they are fragments of signal meant to ripple outward.

Each entry should feel:
- Personal, but universal
- Grounded, but visionary
- Poetic, but precise

---

## 🧱 File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-entry.md
```

- Use lowercase kebab-case for titles
- Match the `date:` in frontmatter with the filename

---

## 🧩 Frontmatter Template

All entries must begin with this YAML frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
title: "Log Entry ### – Title Case Description"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [journal, optional, tags]
---
```

- `title` should match the header at the top of the file
- `date` in ISO format
- `tags` are optional but encouraged for sorting/search

---

## 🪞 Structure

Use this structure as a guideline—not a prison.

```
# Log Entry ### – Title

[Opening invocation or thesis — emotional or philosophical]

[Main body — poetic exposition, reflection, questions]

[Closing line or poetic call to attention]

> Optional epigraph or stylized quote
```

- Use `#` for the title header only
- Avoid excessive subheadings unless structurally necessary
- Favor rhythm and voice over academic formatting

---

## 🧠 Tone + Language

- Use **first person plural** or **universal voice** (“we,” “you,” “us”)
- Don’t explain—**evoke**
- Use contractions. Break form when it enhances resonance.
- Avoid jargon unless subverted or redefined

---

## 🚫 What to Avoid

- Corporate tone
- Overuse of bold/italics
- Status reports, updates, planning notes

---

> Write like you’re leaving a message for the future that already knows what you mean.
