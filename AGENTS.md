# AGENTS.md ‚Äì Content Repository Guide

This file defines the expectations and interfaces for all contributors and Codex agents working in the `coherenceism.content` repository.

---

## üß≠ Purpose

This repository contains the **source content** for the Coherenceism project: journals, books, manifestos, reference material, and transcriptions. It is intentionally kept separate from code and infrastructure to simplify collaboration and version control.

All content is stored in **Markdown (.md)** files and must remain **human-readable and AI-parseable**.

---

## üìÇ Structure

Example directory structure:

```
/journal/
  journal-001-toward-the-coherenceist-os.md
  journal-002-it-learns-what-we-feed-it.md

/book/
  book-001-governance-by-coherence.md

/reference/
  ref-ethics.md
  ref-agents.md
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Content Standards

- Use **semantic filenames** with hyphenated slugs (no spaces).
- Include a **YAML frontmatter block** at the top of every file:

```yaml
---
title: Toward the Coherenceist OS
type: journal
entry: 001
date: 2025-06-21
status: published
tags: [coherenceism, ai, os, vision]
---
```

- Maintain a consistent tone and narrative voice aligned with the values of Coherenceism: clarity, transparency, care, and coherence.

---

## ü§ñ Codex Agent Protocol

Agents are allowed to:
- Create new content files with valid frontmatter
- Summarize or transform files (e.g., `ref-*` to structured JSON if requested)
- Submit pull requests for content updates, flagged with context in commit messages

Agents **must not**:
- Modify existing content without explicit request
- Push directly to `main`
- Generate content without an accompanying commit summary

---

## üß± Human Contributor Notes

- Review pull requests generated by Codex for tone and alignment.
- Keep this file updated with any new folders or conventions.
- Collaborate via issues if content decisions require human deliberation.
